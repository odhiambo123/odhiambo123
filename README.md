### ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m David O, a android application developer at Revature. Over the years I have learned to program in different technologies including Python, Java, Javascript and Kotlin among others. When I'm not coding, I like to jog on the trail, hike, or play/watch rugby-footbal
Working in technology trains the mind to think logically and openly. There is never a time I am not learning something new in the field of technology.

In my June 2022 project with a team of 6 we were tasked with creating an android application that would let the user create a game and host the game online, inviting others to play remotely. This project showcased remote Api consumption,  offline strategy using room db, user authentication using firebase firestore, and localization.

In my July 2022 project I was tasked with  creating an android application that would let the user read emails from a remote host. Once opened, the messages would be marked as read using bold. The user had two tabs, one to take the user to inbox and the other for the settings. This project showcased remote Api consumption,  offline strategy using room db, MVVM design pattern,  and localization
