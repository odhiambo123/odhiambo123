### ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Odhiambo, 
I studied computer science,where I focused on software and computer architecture principles, fundamentals, algorithms and data structures. After college, I continued to practice my software skills by worling with various technologies like HTML CSS Javascript , Python, and most recently Android and Kotlin for mobile app development.

My favorit technologies Kotlin/Android and Python/Flask Python/Django gRPC. One of my favorite projects is the general_py project which I in order to help me learn python better. The general_py project taught me many things about myself including my key strength - Determination.
When I'm not coding, I like to jog on the trail, hike, or play/watch rugby-footbal.
Working in technology trains the mind to think logically and openly. There is never a time I am not learning something new in the field of technology.

In my June 2022 project with a team of 6 we were tasked with creating an android application that would let the user create a game and host the game online, inviting others to play remotely. This project showcased remote Api consumption,  offline strategy using room db, user authentication using firebase firestore, and localization.

In my July 2022 project I was tasked with  creating an android application that would let the user read emails from a remote host. Once opened, the messages would be marked as read using bold. The user had two tabs, one to take the user to inbox and the other for the settings. This project showcased remote Api consumption,  offline strategy using room db, MVVM design pattern,  and localization
