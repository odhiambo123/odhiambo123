Iâ€™m @odhiambo123, a software developer with recent experienc in building multi-tiered applications. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Maryland Global Campus. I have learned to program in different technologies including Python, Java, and Kotlin among others. I naturally enjoy the process of coding and mentoring others.
- I joined [Revature](https://revature.com/referral-software-engineer/?ra=0030P00002GNmMf&ru=0050P0000085FVG) Where I had the opportunity to work on several projects boosting my experience in both back end technologies including Java, Kotlin, SQL, Saleforce CRM, as  well as front end development; HTML/CSS Javascript and Angular. I have experience in DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines deploying to the cloud.
- I enjoy collaborative team envitonments where I can continue to learn from others, and I have worked very hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills. I have played team lead roles involving facilitation of daily team standups and helping to resolve any blockers 
- ðŸŒ± I currently code mostly in Kotlin and Python and ongoing projects include [Android/Kotlin](https://github.com/odhiambo123/Odhi_P1) and [General Python](https://github.com/odhiambo123/general_py)
