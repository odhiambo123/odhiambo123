### ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m David O, a android application developer at Revature. Over the years I have learned to program in different technologies including Python, Java, Javascript and Kotlin among others. I naturally enjoy the process of coding and mentoring. When I'm not coding, I like to jog on the trail, hike, or play/watch rugby-footbal
